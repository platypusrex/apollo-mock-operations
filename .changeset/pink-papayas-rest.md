Updates core and dev dependencies for core and storybook-addon packages. No breaking changes are
expected. Support for storybook v7 will be implemented in the near future. Core graphql-codegen
dependencies have been update in the codegen-plugin package. This will be a breaking change for
anyone using codegen typescript dependencies that are not at least >=4.
